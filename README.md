# Digital Closet: Capsule Wardrobe Outfit Generator

A playful and highly interactive outfit generator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases both front-end development skills and user experience design through a fun, Barbie-themed interface for mixing and matching capsule wardrobe items.

## Purpose

Originally created as a personal project to digitize and randomize capsule wardrobe outfits, this app has grown into a lightweight web-based tool for exploring outfit combinations based on mood or setting (e.g. “casual mode”).

- Logic branching (filtering items by context using keyword heuristics)
- Front-end cleanliness (modular structure, minimal dependencies)
- Creative flair and personal style within web development
